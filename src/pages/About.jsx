              <strong>üåü Background:</strong><br />
              Samuel Oshoffa was born into a Methodist family of Yoruba descent. His father,
              Emmanuel Oshoffa, was a devout Christian and carpenter. Young Samuel was trained
              as a carpenter and trader, not a formally educated theologian.

              <strong>‚ö° Spiritual Calling and the Founding of CCC:</strong><br />
              In 1947, while searching for a missing member of his trading party in the forest
              of Agangue (near Porto-Novo), Oshoffa became lost for three months. During this
              time, he reportedly had divine revelations and was filled with the Holy Spirit.
              <br /><br />
              Upon emerging, he discovered he had received healing powers, prophetic gifts,
              and the ability to raise the dead. The first miracle was the resurrection of his
              nephew. This marked the birth of the Celestial Church of Christ on September 29,
              1947, in Porto-Novo.

              <strong>üìñ Teachings and Mission:</strong><br />
              Oshoffa preached holiness, healing, prophecy, and visions. He emphasized strict
              church doctrines like:
              <ul>
                <li>White garments and no shoes in church</li>
                <li>Men and women seated separately</li>
                <li>Spiritual cleansing, use of holy water</li>
                <li>Belief in angels and God's revelation</li>
              </ul>

              <strong>üåç Legacy:</strong><br />
              CCC spread rapidly through Benin, Nigeria, and globally. Though leadership disputes
              followed his death, the church remains one of the largest African-initiated
              churches. Oshoffa is still regarded as a prophet and spiritual father by millions
              of Celestians.
